# Personal Portfolio

The goal of this portfolio is to provide an updated snapshot of my current professional work and contact. Within this portfolio I wanted to bring my projects to life and have animated gifs opposed to a static screenshot. Users have the ability to reach my social media channels with the click of an icon, download my resume, send me an email through an on-screen modal, or just look at the current time. These features are all possible through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is primarily constructed of Bootstrap/Custom CSS and is Mobile Responsive, adapting to any screen size by stacking into columns and shrinking.
