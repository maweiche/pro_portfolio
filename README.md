# pro_portfolio# Project Title

The goal of this portfolio was to provide an updated snapshot of my current professional work. Within this portfolio I wanted to bring my projects to life and have animated gifs opposed to a static screenshot. Users have the ability to reach my social media channels with the click of an icon, send me an email through an on-screen modal, or just look at the current time and weather. These features are all possible through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is primarily constructed of Bootstrap and custom CSS.
